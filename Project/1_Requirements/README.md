# VEHICLE SPEED LIMITER PROJECT

## INTRODUCTION:
*  A speed limiter is a governor used to limit the top speed of a vehicle. For some classes of vehicles and in some jurisdictions they are a statutory requirement, for some other vehicles the manufacturer provides a non-statutory system which may be fixed or programmable by the driver.Over speeding vehicle make lot of nuisance sometimes also leading to loss of lives and other damages. Also imposing speed restrictions through sign boards have been rendered fruitless wherein the vehicle drivers do not comply with it and resulting catastrophic. Vehicle Speed Limit Controller Project is a great solution to this problem as it not only provides speed limitations, it also implements it through a controlling mechanism. The project works with RF communication between the speed sign post and the vehicle controller system. 

## OBJECTIVE:
* A motor is used here to depict as a vehicle. Whenever a vehicle comes in range of the RF speed sign post, the sign post transmits the speed limit for that particular road to the vehicle system. The vehicle controller system receives this signal through RF receiver and further perceived by the microcontroller. The speed of the vehicle can be incremented / decremented manually with the help of push buttons. If the system was at lower speed than the limit received from the sign post than there will be no changes made to the speed of the system. However, if the speed of the vehicle was manually incremented to a higher value, then the controller will impose the speed restriction and bring back the speed value to the value specified by the limit. Now if the user tries to increase the speed, the system does not allows it to do so till it is in range of the RF speed sign post. The speed of the vehicle and the limits are displayed on an LCD. Thus this system greatly helps in curbing the speed of over speeding vehicles ensuring safety of vehicles on accident prone road ways.

## 5 w's and 1H:
* WHO:
  Almost every person can have an access to use these speed controllers in their own vehicles ,This is mainly used by the police department to check the limitations of the speed of a particular vehicle and this note downs the reading and automatically detects the speed and sends a warn alarm.Although most vehicles come with a built-in speed limiter, you will need to remove it if you want to replace it with an aftermarket device that further reduces speed.

* WHAT:
  A speed limiter is an Intelligent speed assistance (ISA) system that prevents a car from travelling over a set speed. This is not the same concept as cruise control as the car does not maintain this set speed. The driver can still use the accelerator, but the speed limiter prevents the car from going faster if the car reaches the limited speed.

* WHEN:
  Vehicle speed limiters are used in the vehicles ,they are commonly used during to check the speeds of their cars when given to others or to take the safety measures of their own children or themselves.Plan well ahead before overtaking. Be aware that a speed limiter may cause you difficulties when overtaking another vehicle, particularly when climbing a hill.\

* WHY:
  Speed limiters are being implemented in the hope that they will revolutionise road safety. The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) says the limiters would reduce collisions by 30%, and save around 25,000 lives within 15 years . All vehicles in the EU would be fitted with ISA systems to stop drivers from breaking the speed limit. This relieves drivers from having to constantly check their speedometer and means you are less likely to speed and receive penalty points or fines. Moreover, it is thought that these measures will result in benefits for drivers, including higher fuel efficiency, a reduction in CO2 emissions and lower insurance premiums.

* WHICH:
  In all the recent cars the limiters have been as in-built functions from the company,Many recent Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot and Renault models already use ISA systems. Volvo will be the first manufacturer to implements ISA systems in all of their car models.

* HOW:
  Put simply, sensors in your car detect how fast you are going, then this information is communicated to the engine’s computer. When the pre-determined speed is met, the computer restricts the flow of fuel and air to the engine. Therefore, as a driver, you will not be able to exceed the pre-determined top speed. However, all speed limiters can be overridden. If there is a need to speed up quickly, pushing down hard on the accelerator will work. Further, it should be made clear that this system does not affect the car’s braking system.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
 
# STRENGTHS:
* Reduced travel time and Time efficient.
* Equitable allocation of road space policy can be implemented.
* Smooth flow of traffic.
* Decrease the percentage of accidents and brings awareness.

# WEEKNESS:
* An internal electrical fault may occurs.
* Transmission problems.
* Monitaring may be incomplete.
* Limited speed range operations.

# OPPORTUNITIES:
* Prevents vehicle to go for over speed.
* Technology gets matured enough and comes to excistance.
* Control of theoritical research may provide more efficient terms and advantages.

# THREATS:
* Delay in adaptation.
* Cost management.
* Inattention and poor mapping.
* Variance happens and production of older motors gets decreased.

# HIGH LEVEL AND LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS.
* RF Module Transmitter.
* Atmega  Microcontroller.
* RF receiver ,DC motor.
* Motor driver IC.
* 9V Battery.
* Transformer,Rectifier,Regulator.

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS.
* Diode.
* Antenna.
* Switch.
* Decoder and encoder.

# APPLICATIONS:

* Alert the nearby police department or the caretaker.
* These can be used in all the types of motor vehicles like bus,lorry,motor bikes and all the cars.
* They can more generally be used to limit the rotational speed of the internal combustion engine or protect the engine from     damage due to excessive rotational speed.
* The governor is a device which is used to controlling the speed of an engine based on the load requirements. Basic governors sense speed and sometimes load of a prime mover and adjust the energy source to maintain the desired level.
* It helps in safe guarding the passengers and also doesnt allow the vehicle to cross the high speed level.

# ADVANTAGES:

* To avoid accidents.
* To maintain maileage.
* Improved fuel efficieny.
* Reduced emissions.

# DIS ADVANTAGES:

* Unintended safety consequences.
* Incresed congestion.
* Loss of profit for small owning operators.
* There are also concerns that speed-limiting technology might lead to added congestion, and the introduction of black-box style data recorders represents a loss of civil liberties
