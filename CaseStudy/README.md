## MICROWAVE OVEN

# COMPONENTS:

 1)CONTROL PANEL-

An electrical control panel is an enclosure, typically a metal box or plastic moulding which contains important electrical components that control and monitor a number of mechanical processes. Operators will interact with the controls of the panel to operate and control the plant and process.

 2)H.V Transformer-

A high voltage transformer is a type of transformer that operates at a high voltage level.These are usually single-phase core-type transformers. This type of transformer is generally oil immersed. Bakelite sheets are used for separating high tension and low tension windings.

 3)H.V Capacitor-

HV Capacitor features the latest designed manufactured and tested to meet or exceed the requirements of applicable IEC IS standard. Their low cost per kVar make these capacitors a simple, economical source of reactive power on electric power systems for, Feature. All Polypropylene (APP) film dielectric.

 4)H.V Diode-

A high voltage Zener diode is a special type of PN junction diode that is designed to operate in reverse bias (by applying a higher voltage to the N material that to the P material). The Zener diode acts as a normal rectifier until the applied voltage reaches a certain value.

 5)Magnetron-

The magnetron is a high-powered vacuum tube that works as a self-excited microwave oscillator. Crossed electron and magnetic fields are used in the magnetron to produce the high-power output required in radar equipment.

 6)Oven Cavity-

An enclosed heated compartment or receptacle for baking or roasting food.a similar device, usually lined with a refractory material, used for drying substances, firing ceramics, heat-treating, etc. 

 7)Fan Motor-

Fan motors are very simple in construction. They consist of a synchronous or asynchronous electric motor, with a fan wheel of the associated shaft, and the connections for the lines.All motors consist of a stator and contain a rotating rotor inside, which is surrounded by pole-pieces.

 8)Turntable Motor-

Turntable microwaves have a glass tray that sits on a plastic support ring, which rotates constantly during any cooking selection, including models with convection cooking.The turntable can turn in either direction when the microwave starts cooking.

 9)Convection Motor-

Convection can be "forced" by movement of a fluid by means other than buoyancy forces (for example, a water pump in an automobile engine). In other cases, natural buoyancy forces alone are entirely responsible for fluid motion when the fluid is heated, and this process is called "natural convection".

10)Convection Heater-

convection oven technology uses a fan to force air movement and heat up the full interior of the microwave to cook food from the inside out. That's why you can use convection microwaves to bake and roast things that would otherwise be cooked too quickly (and not thoroughly) with just a regular microwave.

11)Grill Heater-

It works by creating an environment similar to an outdoor grill. When you put food on your grill, the exterior of the food gets nice and brown while the inside cooks slowly and evenly. A grill microwave has a heating element inside that radiates heat to simulate the same cooking environment as an outdoor grill.

# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

* Additional features shouldn't be missed.

* Microwave Ovens come in various sizes.

* Power capacity is crucial.

* Size of the kitchen matters,his multifunctional appliance comes in everything.



# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

* Should check the certain things has certain levels .

* If the counter top is level, the microwave should sit level unless the base/microwave is damaged in some manner.

* These doesn't make any issue.
