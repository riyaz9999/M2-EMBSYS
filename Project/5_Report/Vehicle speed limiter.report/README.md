# VEHICLE SPEED LIMITER-

A speed limiter is an Intelligent speed assistance (ISA) system that prevents a car from travelling over a set speed. This is not the same concept as cruise control as the car does not maintain this set speed. The driver can still use the accelerator, but the speed limiter prevents the car from going faster if the car reaches the limited speed.
A speed limiter is a governor used to limit the top speed of a vehicle. For some classes of vehicles and in some jurisdictions they are a statutory requirement, for some other vehicles the manufacturer provides a non-statutory system which may be fixed or programmable by the driver.

# WORKING 

A sheet is being placed on left side of road in traffic prone areas like schools. colonies, hospitals, four ways etc. This is an ordinary sheet which is being made up of any material like aluminum, plastic etc, beside being used in this project this sheet can be utilized for commercial purposes as any brand can commercialize their product through advertisement on it. The length of sheet is taken in such a way that the vehicle of any size is able to cross it easily.The vehicle has IR sensor and controller installed on it. The IR sensor is installed on left side of the car. It sends Infrared signals which strikes the sheet and gets reflected back to the LDR in IR sensor, now the resistor of LDR increases and sends some values to microcontroller. The microcontroller automatically converts these signals into Digital signals and if controller receives a signal of adequate intensity only then it will start counting.

## 5 w's and 1H:
* WHO:
  Almost every person can have an access to use these speed controllers in their own vehicles ,This is mainly used by the police department to check the limitations of the speed of a particular vehicle and this note downs the reading and automatically detects the speed and sends a warn alarm.Although most vehicles come with a built-in speed limiter, you will need to remove it if you want to replace it with an aftermarket device that further reduces speed.

* WHAT:
  A speed limiter is an Intelligent speed assistance (ISA) system that prevents a car from travelling over a set speed. This is not the same concept as cruise control as the car does not maintain this set speed. The driver can still use the accelerator, but the speed limiter prevents the car from going faster if the car reaches the limited speed.

* WHEN:
  Vehicle speed limiters are used in the vehicles ,they are commonly used during to check the speeds of their cars when given to others or to take the safety measures of their own children or themselves.Plan well ahead before overtaking. Be aware that a speed limiter may cause you difficulties when overtaking another vehicle, particularly when climbing a hill.\

* WHY:
  Speed limiters are being implemented in the hope that they will revolutionise road safety. The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) says the limiters would reduce collisions by 30%, and save around 25,000 lives within 15 years . All vehicles in the EU would be fitted with ISA systems to stop drivers from breaking the speed limit. This relieves drivers from having to constantly check their speedometer and means you are less likely to speed and receive penalty points or fines. Moreover, it is thought that these measures will result in benefits for drivers, including higher fuel efficiency, a reduction in CO2 emissions and lower insurance premiums.

* WHICH:
  In all the recent cars the limiters have been as in-built functions from the company,Many recent Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot and Renault models already use ISA systems. Volvo will be the first manufacturer to implements ISA systems in all of their car models.

* HOW:
  Put simply, sensors in your car detect how fast you are going, then this information is communicated to the engine’s computer. When the pre-determined speed is met, the computer restricts the flow of fuel and air to the engine. Therefore, as a driver, you will not be able to exceed the pre-determined top speed. However, all speed limiters can be overridden. If there is a need to speed up quickly, pushing down hard on the accelerator will work. Further, it should be made clear that this system does not affect the car’s braking system.
