# VEHICLE SPEED LIMITER-

A speed limiter is an Intelligent speed assistance (ISA) system that prevents a car from travelling over a set speed. This is not the same concept as cruise control as the car does not maintain this set speed. The driver can still use the accelerator, but the speed limiter prevents the car from going faster if the car reaches the limited speed.
A speed limiter is a governor used to limit the top speed of a vehicle. For some classes of vehicles and in some jurisdictions they are a statutory requirement, for some other vehicles the manufacturer provides a non-statutory system which may be fixed or programmable by the driver.

# WORKING 

A sheet is being placed on left side of road in traffic prone areas like schools. colonies, hospitals, four ways etc. This is an ordinary sheet which is being made up of any material like aluminum, plastic etc, beside being used in this project this sheet can be utilized for commercial purposes as any brand can commercialize their product through advertisement on it. The length of sheet is taken in such a way that the vehicle of any size is able to cross it easily.The vehicle has IR sensor and controller installed on it. The IR sensor is installed on left side of the car. It sends Infrared signals which strikes the sheet and gets reflected back to the LDR in IR sensor, now the resistor of LDR increases and sends some values to microcontroller. The microcontroller automatically converts these signals into Digital signals and if controller receives a signal of adequate intensity only then it will start counting.
